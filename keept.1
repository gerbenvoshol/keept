.TH KEEPT 1 "2023-11-11" "keept 1.3" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
keept \- keep pseudo terminal (with (multi) attach/detach)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B keept
.I FLAGS
.I socket
.RI [ OPTS ]
.RI [ NAME = VALUE ]...
.RI [ COMMAND
.RI [ ARG ]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B KeePt
runs command under a separate pseudo terminal and keeps the master
side open in a daemon process.
.PP
User may then (re)connect to this daemon process and get terminal access
to the command running there.
.PP
The unix domain socket used to connect to the daemon process can accept
multiple simultaneous connections and user may disconnect any of the
connections at will.
.PP
This interface works pretty much like what dtach(1) provides, but the
feature set is slightly different. abduco(1) is similar to these.
screen(1) and tmux(1) are more versatile alternatives whenever needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.B KeePt
tries to provide convenient command line interface to the users,
YMMV. To reach this SYNOPSIS is divided in 3 parts: flags, socket,
options and process command line arguments.
.SS FLAGS
.PP
.B Connection time redraw flags:
.TP
.B q
redraw mode is none \(em when reconnecting to keept daemon don't request
anything to be done in this sense. window size does not change. this
option unsets all previosly given 'b', 'w' or 'l' options (if any)
.TP
.B b
redraw mode buffer \(em request keept daemon to send the contents of
circular buffer that contains last output to client. with this flag
buffer size defaults to 1024, otherwise it is zero (0) (see \-s below)
.TP
.B bw
in addition to the above, client sends window size information and
if it differs what daemon thinks WINCH is sent to process (may be
useful e.g. for curl(1) to change width of the progress bar)
.TP
.B l
redraw mode is ctrl-l: daemon writes ctrl-l to process and it responds
as it wishes (e.g. emacs will redraw its window). window size is
not changing (at this time)
.TP
.B lw
if client and daemon agrees on window size, ctrl-l is sent, if not
WINCH is sent to the process
.TP
.B w
WINCH is sent to the process (if terminal size changes)
.PP
Without any of the above, connection time redraw mode is what was given
when KeePt started, and if none was given at that time, 'lw' is used.
.PP
The above flags affect how ctrl-l is handled from user input; if either
'l' or 'w' is active, window size will first be communicated to the daemon
\(em and if size differs, WINCH is sent to the process.
.PP
.B Other flags:
.TP
.B a
attach only \(em if COMMAND [ARG] were given, those are ignored. if
socket is not live, exit
.TP
.B n
execute COMMAND [ARG] but no attach. print failure if COMMAND [ARG]
is not given
.TP
.B m
must create \(em COMMAND [ARG] must be given and socket must not be
live when this flag is there
.TP
.B r
"read only"; when attaching, terminal input is discarded by client
(and if daemon got it, it would also discard received input)
.TP
.B x
instead of sending WINCH to resize process running under keept daemon
(attempt to) resize client terminal using common escape sequences
.TP
.B t
attach to the process under keept control even there is no local tty
.TP
.B z
when (re)attaching, send ctrl-z as first input
.TP
.B L
list active sessions \(em the socket argument is interpreted as a
directory path. keept will scan for socket files in that directory
and test each to see if it is an active keept session. Only live
sessions are displayed. This is useful for discovering what keept
sessions are currently running.
.TP
.B @
in system supporting "abstract socket namespace" (linux) bind/connect
to socket in abstract socket namespace
.TP
.B u
keept daemon unlinks the pathname/filesystem socket when it exits.
effective only when daemon starts and executes given COMMAND [ARG]
.TP
.B \-
no-op \(em provided for user convenience
.SS socket
The socket name (filename or name in abstract socket namespace) what to
bind by keept daemon or where to connect by keept client. Unix domain
socket of SOCK_SEQPACKET type.
.PP
If filesystem socket exists and is not live, it is considerd as it did
not exist at all (unlinked before rebinding).
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-s " size
circular buffer size. 1024 is 'b' is given in FLAGS, circular
buffer size defaults to 1024, otherwise w/o this, there will
be no buffering
.TP
.BI "\-g " {rows}x{cols}
instead of using current window size use the one given
with this argument. most useful when there is no tty
.TP
.BI "\-o " filename
do script(1) like logging to filename (no buffering). the
file is initially unreadable (chmod 000) since e.g. cat(1)
to the file would cause live loop and file filling up
quickly
.SS NAME=VALUE...
Set each NAME to VALUE in the environment (if any).
.SS COMMAND [[ARG]...]
The command (and its arguments) to be executed when the socket argument
given is not available/live (and 'm' explicitly requests this).
.SH ESCAPE CHARACTER
The keept client detaches from keept daemon by entering Ctrl-Z on
attached terminal. Currently there is no way to disable or change
this character.
.PP
Ctrl-Z can be sent to process with 'z' flag in keept command line
(i.e. reattach after ctrl-z with 'z' in FLAGS argument).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B KeePt
gets its environment from (grand)parent process, and process started
by keept from keept.
.TP
.B KEEPT_PID
is added to keept environment before it starts its child
process. It is internally used by keept to avoid re-attaching
keept socket, which would be problematic.
.TP
.B KEEPT_SOCKARG
contains the value of socket argument verbatim. Users
may find use for it...
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B keept bw a-socket zsh
Create a new session with buffer and winch redraw modes
.TP
.B keept L /tmp
list active sessions in /tmp
.TP
.B keept L .
list active sessions in current directory
